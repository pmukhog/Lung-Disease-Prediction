# Lung-Disease-Prediction
Detection and classification of lung anomalies in chest CT scans


Human lung anomalies, including diseases like pneumonia, edema, and 
tuberculosis, are somewhat common in today's culture. A few image processing techniques 
used for lung illness prediction are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Visual Geometry 
Group (VGG), Densely Connected Network (DenseNet), and Residual Neural Network 
(ResNet). Using chest CT scans, a multi-classification system will be developed in this work 
to predict various lung illnesses. Several Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and 
NumPy, were used in the project. The study employed VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet121 deep learning frameworks with the NIH chest radiographs dataset that was sourced from 
the Kaggle repository. ResNet-50, VGG-16, and DenseNet-121 were found to have accuracy 
scores of 56%, 75%, and 88%, respectively. For precise predictions from scans, 
preprocessing techniques like feature selection, data augmentation, and dimensionality 
reduction are essential. The study's overall goal was to produce trustworthy and precise 
predictions of lung ailments based on the imagery and to show how effective it is to use the 
particular combination of deep learning algorithms.
